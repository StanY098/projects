                    success on taking any photographs. In the

                    Tripod is a stand with three legs. With the three
                    legs, a camera can stand very firmly that it will
                    not move. There are many situations that tripod is
                    very useful for photographing, for example, group
                    photos, night views, self-taking photos and so on.
                    For most of the tripods, they have at least three
                    sections of legs so that users can adjust the
                    height according to users' needs. If it is not
                    high enough even though the three sections of legs
                    have been extended, the stick at the middle of the
                    tripod can also allow you to make it much higher
                    by pulling up the stick.

                    With more
                    functions in a tripod, some of the tripods also
                    the angle balancing sensor to detect if the camera
                    (or the setting of the tripod) is balanced or not
                    (such that if the liquid in the sensor is at the
                    middle, the camera is placed completely
                    horizontally.)

                <p>
                    External flash light is a flash light not to be
                    installed in camera. It gives a great help to
                    give supplmentary light for photos. You can plug it
                    on the top of camera or use some wireless equipment
                    to connect both the flash light and camera together.
                    Therefore, you will be able to fill more light for
                    the necessary parts. Also, inside the flash light,
                    you can pull out a paper or a plastic guard. They
                    are very useful for spreading the light equally.

                <p>
                    Some people may have questions about why we still
                    need an external flash light when we have already 
                    had the internal flash light and why the
                    professionals do not use the internal flash light
                    but the external. It is because the internal
                    flash light has the disadvantages of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        limited area to be lighted (which will also
                        make light too concentrated)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        immovable that you cannot choose the area
                        you want to light on
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        fixed intensity (which may make the light
                        too intense when we do not need that much)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    External flash light can solve all problems I
                    mentioned from internal flash light. External flash
                    light is movable, has a paper or plastic guard to
                    spread out lightt and adjust the intensity of light
                    from the setting of external flash light. Therefore,
                    external flash light brings great advantages while
                    internal flash light cannot.

                <p>
                    External shutter cord is a cord that can connect to
                    camera. With the external shutter cord, users can
                    control the time use to take photographs manually.
                    To make it work, we need to change the setting of
                    aperture to "BULB". As I mentioned before, the
                    range of aperture usually for a camera is from
                    1/4000 seconds to 30 seconds. "BULB" is right out
                    of (or next to) the 30 seconds setting. Therefore,
                    as we adjust to "BULB", we just need to adjust to
                    30 seconds and then the next one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The external shutter cord is very useful for taking
                    night view or star view (star or star track). If
                    you love stars and love to take some star
                    photographs, external shutter cord will be your
                    great helper.

                    Cleaning Supply
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Since camera lens are very important for
                    photographing, it is needed to be careful to clean
                    the lens. Otherwise, the whole lens will be useless
                    if it is damaged. Therefore, a special cleaning
                    supply for cameras is introduced for users. I will
                    introduce the following three: air blower, cleaning
                    fluid and microfiver cleaning cloths.

                            Air Blower is like an air pump seen in a science
                            lab. However, it has a totally different function.
                            In order to clean out dust without having chances
                            to damage the lens, the air blower can blow out
                            the dust without any contact. Therefore, air blower
                            is a very nice tool to clear out dust from the
                            surface of the lens.

                            Sometimes there are some oil or fingerprint
                            stain. It is hard to clean only by water
                            (hard to dry and hard to wash). Also, it
                            may also leave some marks on lens when water
                            is going to be dried out. The special
                            cleaning fluid can help clean the stain
                            directly and completely but we don't have
                            to worry about drying out the fluid or
                            water. As we use it with microfiber
                            cleaning cloths, all stain can be removed
                            immediately.

                            cloth is needed. Microfiber cleaning
                            cloths is special designed cloths. Its
                            materials are very capable to clean up
