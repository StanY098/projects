                <h3>
                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Aperture is one of the three basic elements for
                    photographing. The other two elements are
                    <a href="iso.html">ISO</a>
                    and
                    <a href="shutter.html">Shutter</a>.
                    Aperture is to check a measurement of the size of
                    the aperture. By checking it, the camera checks on
                    the radius of the aperture, the bigger the radius is,
                    the larger the aperture is. The lens' aperture
                    range is F1 (the largest aperture), F2.8, F4.0,
                    F5.6, all the way up to F22 (the smallest aperture).
                    It depends on a specific lens.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Caution
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Please be careful! The camera will show F2.8 as
                    your aperture, for instance. the number 2.8,
                    however, means how thick is between the aperture
                    and the lens. Therefore, the less the number
                    is for the F, the greater aperture is.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Comparison
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Figure 1.3 and figure 1.4 show the difference of
                    the sizes of aperture. As we can see in figure 1.3
                    (F1.8), the radius in the middle is a way larger
                    than figure 1.4 (F11).

                    The difference between a Small Aperture with a
                    Slow Shutter and a Large Aperture with a Fast
                    Shutter
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Aperture and
                    <a href="shutter.html">Shutter</a>
                    have a very strong and
                    closed relationship between each other. Having
                    a small aperture with a slow shutter and a large
                    aperture with a fast shutter seems to have the
                    same and appropriate light for a photograph, but
                    there is still a difference between these two
                    settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aperture not only enlarge the amount of light
                    abosrption, but also make background blur.
                    The larger the aperture is, the greater difference
                    between the object and the background (more blur
                    at the background). Shallow depth of field (making
                    background blur so that the object can be more
                    emphasized) is an example to apply this setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as we take group pictures and want to
                    take clear and plain pictures. A large aperture
                    cannot be applied. Therefore, another setting (a
                    small aperture with a slow shutter) can be better
                    applied. A small aperture can help make a completely
                    clear picture. Even though a slow shutter may cause
                    objects blur because of movement, it is still a
                    small matter for the whole picture, comparing to
                    blur, except it is sporty or for a highly moving
                    activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compare figures 1.5 and 1.6, figure 1.5 with using
                    aperture F3.2 is more blur than figure 1.6 with
                    using aperture F25. The more light the lens
                    receive, the more spread of light the picture will
                    be.

                    Therefore, to determine it should be a small
                    aperture with a slow shutter or a large aperture
                    with a fast shutter, the type or purpose for a
                    picture is very important, to make it blur or not.

                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Aperture refers to the size of open lens radius. The
                    smaller the number is, the larger the aperture is.
                    Higher aperture may also make pictures blur. If you
                    still don't have enough light, you can also use an
                    <a href="equip.html">external flash light</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    REMEMBER: Low Aperture will make the whole picture
                    clear but receive less light. High Aperture will
                    make the whole picture blur but receive more light.
