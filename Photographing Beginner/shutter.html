                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Shutter is one of the three basic elements for
                    photographing. The other two elements are
                    <a href="iso.html">ISO</a>
                    and
                    <a href="aperture.html">Aperture</a>.
                    Shutter is a measurement of how fast a camera
                    close the lens' gate to finish photographing
                    taking. General shutter range is from 30 seconds
                    (the slowest) to 1/4000 seconds (the fastest) or
                    even more. If more than 30 seconds is needed, an
                    <a href="equip.html">external shutter cord</a> is
                    needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Range: 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 6, ...... 1/100, 1/150,
                    1/200, ...... 1/1000, 1/1250, 1/2500, 1/4000 ......
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Caution
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The fastest shutter is not always the best and
                    the slowest shutter is not always the worst. It
                    indeed depends on situations. The speed of shutter
                    also affects the amount of light received. The
                    fastest the shutter is, the less amount of light
                    receives. If we use a fast shutter in a very dark
                    environment, the picture will be so dark.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Comparison
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We can compare the figures 1.7 and 1.8. Figure
                    1.7 shows a picture with slow speed. It shows that
                    the water become blur and unclear when the water
                    comes out from the tap. On the other hand, very
                    clear water droplets can be seen in figure 1.8,
                    which uses a fast speed to take.

                <h3>
                    Security Shutter
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest enemy against Shutter is hand tremor.
                    Every photographer hate taking a very good picture
                    but with a hand-tremor result. What a waste, right?
                    There is term that every photographer can follow
                    and it highly avoids hand tremor for most of the
                    time. The term is Security Shutter. Security
                    Shutter range is from 1/60 (someone even say for
                    1/100) to 1/200. This range can take a lot of
                    general and normal picture. Certainly, this range
                    does not 100% ensure you to totally avoid hand
                    tremor, but a good guideline to follow. Shutter
                    which goes larger than the security may cause
                    users to be aware of because it will easily to
                    cause had-tremor pictures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, using a <a href="equip.html">tripod</a> is
                    a very good choice for preventing hand tremor.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Therefore, shutter is a measure of speed for a
                    camera to take a picture. The larger the number
                    is for the shutter, the slower the shutter is and
                    the more light the camera receives.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    REMEMBER: Determine your shutter based on situations
                    and experiences. Do not just use fast shutter to
                    take all pictures.
